## 🌟 Development

### File Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `app` and `assets`. Here's a breakdown of their contents and relationships:

#### **`/app`**
This directory contains the core application logic, including screens, hooks, utilities, and navigation.

- **`/screens`**:  
  Contains all the UI screens for the app, organized into subdirectories based on functionality (e.g., `Auth`, `CalanderScreen`, `LocationScreen`). Each screen represents a specific feature or page in the app.

- **`/hooks`**:  
  Contains custom React hooks for managing global state and context. Examples include:
  - `AuthContext.tsx`: Manages user authentication state.
  - `LanguageContext.tsx`: Handles language settings and translations.
  - `LocationContext.tsx`: Manages location-related data and coordinates.
  - `CalendarSettings.tsx`: Stores calendar preferences like type and visibility of specific features.
  - `ThemeContext.tsx`: Manages light and dark themes.

- **`/navigations`**:  
  Contains navigation logic for the app.
  - `AppNavigator.tsx`: Defines the stack navigation for authentication and the main app.
  - `DrawerLayout.tsx`: Implements the drawer navigation for accessing different screens.

- **`/utils`**:  
  Contains utility functions and services. Examples:
  - `DateUtils.tsx`: Provides date-related utilities, including Jewish calendar calculations.
  - `StorageService.ts`: Handles persistent storage using `AsyncStorage`.

- **`_layout.tsx`**:  
  The root layout file that wraps the app with all necessary providers (e.g., `AuthProvider`, `LanguageProvider`).

#### **`/assets`**
This directory contains static resources and shared configurations.

- **`/Models`**:  
  Contains TypeScript models and enums for structured data. Examples:
  - `UserData.ts`: Defines the structure of user-related data.
  - `Prisha.ts`: Enum for different types of `Prisha` (Jewish calendar events).
  - `Events.ts`: Enum and metadata for calendar events.

- **`/translations.ts`**:  
  Contains translations for different languages (e.g., English, Hebrew). Used by `LanguageContext` to provide localized strings.

- **`/LanguageConfig.ts`**:  
  Defines supported languages and their layout directions (LTR or RTL).

- **`/firebase`**:  
  Contains Firebase configuration and services. Examples:
  - `firebaseConfig.ts`: Initializes Firebase with project credentials.
  - `firebaseService.ts`: Provides functions for interacting with Firestore (e.g., saving and retrieving user data).

- **`/colors.ts`**:  
  Defines color themes for light and dark modes.

- **`/images`**:  
  Stores static image assets (e.g., icons, splash screens).

#### **Relationships Between Files**
1. **Context Providers (`/hooks`)**:  
   Provide global state and functionality to the app.  
   Example: `AuthContext` manages user authentication and is used in screens like `LoginScreen` and `SignupScreen`.

2. **Screens (`/screens`)**:  
   Consume context and utilities to render UI and handle user interactions.  
   Example: `CalendarScreen` uses `DateUtils` for date calculations and `CalendarSettingsContext` for user preferences.

3. **Utilities (`/utils`)**:  
   Provide reusable logic and helper functions.  
   Example: `StorageService` is used by `LocationContext` and `CalendarSettingsContext` to persist data.

4. **Assets (`/assets`)**:  
   Serve as a centralized location for static resources and shared configurations.  
   Example: `translations.ts` is used by `LanguageContext` to provide localized strings.

This structure ensures modularity, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to scale and manage the app.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Firebase
Ensure you have a valid Firebase configuration in `assets/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts`. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project credentials.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys). Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore`.

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Native Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro/) for unit and component testing.

### Adding Tests

- Create test files alongside your components or in a `__tests__` folder.
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` (e.g., `MyComponent.test.tsx`).
- Example test file for a component:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { render } from '@testing-library/react-native';
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

  test('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(getByText('Hello')).toBeTruthy();
  });
  ```

### Running Tests

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Or, for more detailed output:
  ```bash
  npx jest
  ```

### Test Coverage

- To see code coverage:
  ```bash
  npx jest --coverage
  ```

> Make sure you have `jest` and `@testing-library/react-native` installed. If not, install them with:
> ```bash
> npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native
> ```
